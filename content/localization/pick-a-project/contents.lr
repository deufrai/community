We want our tools to be available and localized for anyone who wants to use them and appreciate your help. To find out where your knowledge may be most helpful, take a look at the translation progress for the Tor ecosystem of tools so far:

Although we would value your contribution to any of the projects above, the most critical are Tor Browser, the Tor Browser User Manual, and our Support Portal:

* Tor Browser is translated in many different Transifex resources, but you can see the [Tor Browser total strings translated per language](https://torpat.ch/locales) to see where help is needed.
* The Tor Browser User Manual is a very useful resource for new users that do not speak English, see [Tor Browser User Manual translation statistics](https://torpat.ch/manual-locales) or [translate](https://www.transifex.com/otf/tor-project-support-community-portal/tbmanual-contentspot/).
* The [Support Portal](https://support.torproject.org/) is also a valuable resource for all Tor users, see [Tor Support Portal translation statistics](https://torpat.ch/support-locales) or [translate](https://www.transifex.com/otf/tor-project-support-community-portal/support-portal/)
* The [Community Portal](https://community.torproject.org/) is this website, where you can find ways to contribute to Tor.
